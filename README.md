# File Uploads in ASP.NET MVC with View Models

Working code sample compiled from snippets provided by this tutorial: https://cpratt.co/file-uploads-in-asp-net-mvc-with-view-models/


## What concepts are demonstrated?

- use a single MVC view model to describe an entity including data provided by file uploads
- provide separate models for domain modelling and presentation purposes
- MVC model binding - controller actions use complex type parameters
- MVC model validation - model class uses data annotations
